# Git Workflow

We use rebasing and commit squashing to keep `main` well-organized, with the goal of having just a few commits on `main` per story. Our squash/rebase strategy allows us to do this without requiring you to avoid making commits on your branches -- commit to your heart's content, then cleanup before creating your PR!
